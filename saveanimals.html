                                <h2>Research Animals</h2>
                                <p>Should Animals Be Used In Research:</p>
                                <p>

                                    Humans and animals live together since the first day of humanity. They are an important part of our lives. Over time, scientists began to use animals in their research to determine methods for treatment, and this has sparked controversy from the past and present. Should animals be used in research? Or should it be banned?<br><br>
                                    Imagine a syringe being forced down your throat to inject a chemical into your stomach, or being restrained and forced to breathe sickening vapours for hours. That’s the cruel reality of animal testing for millions of mice, rabbits, dogs and other animals worldwide.<br><br>

                                    There was a scare when parabens were found in breast tumours, but there is no conclusive evidence that the parabens caused the tumours. Skincare and cosmetic companies are facing high pressure from consumers and health practitioners who want them to reduce or remove parabens from their products.<br><br>

                                    Did you know that animal testing is legally required for many of the products we use every day? From fragrances to painkillers to the fabric dyes in our clothing, every new chemical has at one time been force-fed to animals. HSI is working around the globe in cooperation with companies and government authorities to replace cruel and obsolete animal-poisoning tests with modern alternatives that better protect human and environmental safety. </p>
                                <h2>Animal Testing Facts</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Government regulations often require numerous different animal-poisoning tests to assess the hazards of a single new chemical, pesticide or medicinal product.
                                    Some tests use thousands of animals at a time, while others are repeated two or even three times using different animal species or routes of administration (oral force-feeding, forced inhalation or skin); no pain relief is provided.
                                    There’s no “humane” way to poison animals with chemicals or to infect them with deadly diseases like rabies to test the effectiveness of a vaccine; however, there are modern non-animal alternatives that work just as well—or better. HSI works through intergovernmental bodies such as the OECD to accelerate global adoption of modern non-animal testing methods, and through our network of country offices to have these new approaches taken up through national regulations.
                                    Our efforts have been instrumental in securing “mandatory alternatives” requirements in Brazil and South Korea, whereby it is illegal for a company to conduct animal experimentation if a non-animal approach is available. We’re also helping pass bans on cosmetic animal testing around the world through our #BeCrueltyFree campaign. </p>
                                <h2>Save Ralph</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Terrified animals are still suffering in laboratories across the globe in government-mandated tests of cosmetic ingredients. Cosmetic chemicals are forced down their throats, dripped into their eyes or smeared onto their skin before they are killed and dissected. </p>
                                <h4>Cosmetic Testing Facts</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Cosmetic animal tests are archaic chemical-poisoning experiments devised more than half a century ago, such as rodent “lethal dose” tests (1920s), rabbit eye and skin irritation tests (1940s) and guinea pig skin allergy tests (1950s).
                                    Modern non-animal methods are available for the most cosmetic safety issues, and have been shown to better predict human responses in the real-world than the animal tests they replace.
                                    Cruelty-free brands like Lush, Dove and Herbal Essences create innovative new products safely by relying on modern non-animal tests in combination with existing ingredients with established histories of safe use.
                                    HSI and our partners are working to ban cosmetic animal testing in the world’s largest and most influential beauty markets, as well as the sale of cosmetic products or ingredients that have been newly animal-tested in any other part of the world.
                                    Our campaign was instrumental in driving the European Union to become the world’s largest cruelty-free cosmetic market, and in securing subsequent bans in India, Taiwan, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, Guatemala, and in numerous states in Brazil.
                                    Bans are just the beginning; HSI and our industry partners in the Animal-Free Safety Assessment Collaboration are also supporting training in developing countries to help companies and government authorities transition to modern non-animal methods.</p>

                                <p>Recently, the short film Save Ralph once again drew attention to experiments on animals.

                                    Published by the Humane Society International and watched by 2 million people since April 6, the movie "Save Ralph" tells the daily life of a rabbit used in dermatological tests in clinical laboratories. As if in an interview, Rabbit Ralph tells the audience his situation and why he is in this situation. According to Ralph, this is his job, and if everyone is tried on animals; If he stops purchasing cosmetics such as eyeliner, shampoo, sunscreen, he may become a free rabbit running through the gardens and forests rather than being a test rabbit.</p>
